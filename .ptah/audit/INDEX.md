# Audit Index — Guestbook

Feature-to-file map. Regenerated each audit run; the authoritative cross-reference
downstream workers navigate. Stack: CodeIgniter 3.1.5 on PHP `>=5.3.7`, MySQL

## Debt anchors (see legacy_debt.md)

| ID | Anchor | Severity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| SEC-1 | `#stored-xss` | Critical |
| SEC-2 | `#hardcoded-db-credentials` | Critical |
| SEC-3 | `#hardcoded-encryption-key` | Critical |
| SEC-4 | `#csrf-disabled` | Critical |
| SEC-5 | `#db-debug-leak` | High |
| BUG-1 | `#timeline-time-bug` | High |
| BUG-2 | `#silent-insert-success` | High |
| BUG-3 | `#model-ctor` | High |
| DEBT-1 | `#active-record-coupling` | Medium |
| DEBT-2 | `#no-test-coverage` | Medium |
| DEBT-3 | `#no-reproducible-env` | Medium |
| DEBT-4 | `#eol-framework` | Medium |
| DEBT-6 | `#no-ci-pipeline` | Medium |
| DEAD-1 | `#dead--unused-code` | Resolved (`tsk-010`) |

## Strangler Fig seams

| ID | Seam | Tracked by |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| STR-1 | GuestbookRepository persistence port | tsk-003 (Seam 1) |
| STR-2 | Output-encoding boundary in timeline view | Seam 2 (post-tsk-002) |
| STR-3 | Validation/sanitization + spam-scoring service | tsk-004 |

## Stage 2 (Design) status

`design_status: pending-validation` (see `system.md`). The Stage-2 architecture
(modular monolith / Strangler Fig on CI 3.x, four seams) and the five confirmed
`Pending` standards await human CTO sign-off before Stage 3 (product-owner-worker)
may generate tasks.

## Task queue traceability

The seed queue in `.ptah/tasks/` traces to this audit: `tsk-001` → `#no-reproducible-env`,
`tsk-002` → `#no-test-coverage`, `tsk-003` → `#active-record-coupling` / STR-1,
`tsk-004` → `features/spam-filter.md` / STR-3, `tsk-010` → `#dead--unused-code`
(resolved — Welcome demo removed).

`tsk-001` in progress: its acceptance gate,
`application/tests/schema/MessagesSchemaProvisioningTest.php`, has landed, but the
`schema/messages.sql` deliverable it gates has not — the test itself reports the
schema as missing. `#no-reproducible-env` remains open.
